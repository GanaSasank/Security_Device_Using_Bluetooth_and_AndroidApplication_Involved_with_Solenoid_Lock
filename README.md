# Security_Device_Using_Bluetooth_and_AndroidApplication_Involved_with_Solenoid_Lock
Technology has improved, and smart locking systems have become more sophisticated. In this case, the android-based Smart System is primarily intended for multimode operations. we introduced a form of smart technology that utilized Bluetooth while using a mobile smartphone. Consequently, using it will be simpler and more effective.
# Working:
•We have to give sufficient voltage of power supply through Arduino, It can be achieved by connecting the Arduino to your PC through USB.

•After giving power supply, then open the application, probably you will find the apk file in the repository.

•We’ve to turn on bluetooth in mobile and connect the mobile with HC05 bluetooth module, then connecting the bluetooth icon in app changes to lock icon.

•After that, we’ve to touch fingerprint icon. When we touch it, it will give message
that unlock with fingerprint.

•Now keep the finger on your mobile fingerprint sensor.

•If it matches the fingerprint set in our phone, then it changes the lock to on position and the same time lock icon changes to unlock icon.
